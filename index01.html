            <p>Hello, my name is John Rodriguez. I am an English teacher with 17 years of experience. I grew up in
                Naples, Florida
                (USA), where I graduated from Naples High School and earned several IT certifications, including A+,
                Network+, and
                Server+.

            <p>Throughout my career, I have taught students of all ages—from preschool to university—and also trained
                corporate groups
                and professionals in private online classes. I have worked with learners from Colombia, Mexico,
                Argentina, Chile, the
                USA, Spain, the Netherlands, Japan, and China.</p>

            <p>Currently, I lead an online English program for adult professionals, offering courses in General
                English, Technical
                English, Exam Preparation, and adaptation training for newcomers to English-speaking countries. My goal
                is to help
                students communicate with confidence, improve their careers, and succeed internationally.</p>
