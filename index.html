            <p>Hello, my name is John Rodriguez. I
                am an English teacher with 17 years of experience. I grew up in
                Naples, Florida (USA), where I graduated from Naples High School and earned several IT certifications,
                including A+, Network+, and Server+. </p>

            <h2>My Hometown: Floridablanca</h2>
            <img src="https://www.amb.gov.co/images/Floridablanca.JPG" alt="A picture og my home town" width="320px"
                height="auto">
            <p>My hometown is Floridablanca, a city in the department of Santander, Colombia. It is close to
                Bucaramanga, and together they form a large metropolitan area. Floridablanca is about 925 meters above
                sea level and is known for its beautiful parks. One important place is the Piedra del Sol, a big ancient
                rock with carvings made by the Guane people more than 1,000 years ago.</p>

                alt="The City of Arts and Sciences" width="600px" height="auto">
            <p>My favorite city in the world is Valencia, in Spain. It is the third-largest city in the country. I like
                it because it has a special mix of historic buildings and modern, futuristic architecture, especially
                the famous City of Arts and Sciences. It is a beautiful and interesting place to visit.</p>
